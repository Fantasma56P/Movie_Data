# Movie_Data
PROJECT OBJECTIVE
In this project, we analyzed a dataset containing information about movies released over the years — including actors, directors, genres, revenues, and budgets — to determine which film genre is the most profitable.

Steps Followed
1 - First, we created a movie pivot table and selected the data we would use.
2 - We added the selected data to the pivot table.
3 - We calculated the average revenues of each movie genre.
4 - We prepared a table showing which genre is the most profitable.

Tool Used
Google Sheets

Key Findings
Looking at our table, the top five film genres with the highest profitability rates are Adventure, Family, Sci-Fi, Animation, and Fantasy, as the result of our analysis.
